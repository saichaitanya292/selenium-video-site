<h1>Selenium Automation Tutorial Using Java</h1>

<p>
Selenium automation testing using Java is one of the most popular approaches
for testing modern web applications. Java is widely used in enterprise
applications, and Selenium integrates seamlessly with Java-based testing
frameworks, making it a preferred choice for automation engineers.
</p>

<p>
This page is designed as a beginner-friendly learning guide that explains
Selenium automation concepts step by step. The focus is on understanding how
Selenium works with Java in real-world testing projects rather than simply
running scripts.
</p>

<h2>Who Should Learn Selenium with Java?</h2>

<p>
This tutorial is suitable for beginners who want to start a career in test
automation, manual testers looking to upgrade their skills, and developers who
want to understand automated testing concepts.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Basic understanding of Java programming</li>
  <li>JDK installed on your system</li>
  <li>An IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of HTML and web applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Setting Up Selenium with Java</h2>

<p>
To use Selenium with Java, dependencies must be added to the project. Most
projects use Maven or Gradle to manage Selenium libraries. Maven simplifies
dependency management and ensures consistent versions across environments.
</p>

<p>
Once dependencies are configured, browser drivers such as ChromeDriver are
required to communicate with web browsers.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Launching a Browser Using WebDriver</h2>

<p>
Selenium WebDriver provides an interface to control browsers programmatically.
Once the browser driver is configured, a WebDriver instance can be created to
launch and control the browser.
</p>

<pre>
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://example.com");
</pre>

<h2>Step 3: Locating Web Elements</h2>

<p>
Selenium interacts with web elements using locators. Commonly used locators
include ID, name, class name, XPath, and CSS selectors. Choosing reliable
locators is essential for building stable automation scripts.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Handling Waits in Selenium</h2>

<p>
Web applications often load elements dynamically. Selenium provides implicit
and explicit waits to handle such scenarios. Explicit waits are recommended
because they wait for specific conditions before interacting with elements.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Page Object Model (POM)</h2>

<p>
The Page Object Model is a design pattern that improves maintainability by
separating page structure from test logic. Each web page is represented as a
class, making automation code cleaner and easier to manage.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps in Learning Selenium with Java</h2>

<p>
After understanding the basics, learners should explore advanced topics such as
test frameworks (TestNG or JUnit), data-driven testing, reporting, and CI/CD
integration. Practical project experience is key to mastering Selenium
automation.
