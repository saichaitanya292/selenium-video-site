<h1>Selenium Automation Tutorial Using Python</h1>

<p>
Selenium automation testing using Python is a popular choice among testers and
developers because of Python’s simple syntax and readability. Python allows
learners to focus on understanding automation concepts without dealing with
complex language features.
</p>

<p>
This page is designed as an educational guide for beginners who want to learn
how Selenium works with Python in real-world web automation projects. The focus
is on explaining concepts clearly and step by step.
</p>

<h2>Who Should Learn Selenium with Python?</h2>

<p>
This tutorial is suitable for beginners in automation testing, manual testers
who want to transition to automation, and developers interested in learning
browser automation using Python.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Basic understanding of Python programming</li>
  <li>Python installed on your system</li>
  <li>pip package manager</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of web applications and HTML</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Selenium in Python</h2>

<p>
Selenium can be installed easily using the pip package manager. It is
recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
</p>

<pre>
pip install selenium
</pre>

<h2>Launching a Browser Using WebDriver</h2>

<p>
Selenium WebDriver provides an API to control browsers programmatically. Browser
drivers such as ChromeDriver act as a bridge between Selenium and the browser.
</p>

<pre>
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")
</pre>

<h2>Locating Web Elements</h2>

<p>
Selenium interacts with web elements using locators. Common locators include ID,
name, class name, XPath, and CSS selectors. Choosing stable and unique locators
is essential for reliable automation scripts.
</p>

<h2>Handling Waits in Selenium</h2>

<p>
Modern web applications load content dynamically. Selenium provides implicit
and explicit waits to handle synchronization issues. Explicit waits are
recommended because they wait for specific conditions before interacting with
elements.
</p>

<h2>Using PyTest with Selenium</h2>

<p>
PyTest is a popular testing framework used with Selenium in Python projects. It
simplifies test execution, supports fixtures, and generates clear test reports.
PyTest is commonly used in professional automation frameworks.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps in Learning Selenium with Python</h2>

<p>
After learning the basics, learners should explore advanced topics such as
framework design, Page Object Model, data-driven testing, and CI/CD integration.
Hands-on practice with real projects is the best way to gain confidence.
